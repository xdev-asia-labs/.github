![xdev.asia Hands-On Labs Banner](assets/banner.png)

A collection of hands-on labs that power the **[xdev.asia](https://xdev.asia)** blog — a playground for experimenting with system architecture, AI agents, internal developer platforms, automation, and intelligent operating models.

## 🎯 Mission

Pursue an AI-first mindset and intelligent system architecture. I build solutions by combining technology, creativity, and the ability to see structure in chaos — the toolkit for becoming a Solution Architect.

## 🧪 Lab Tracks

- **AI Agents & Orchestration**: LLMs, workflow engines, event-driven patterns, and context graphs.
- **System Architecture**: Domain-driven design, modular monolith vs. microservices, and integration patterns.
- **Platform Engineering**: Golden paths, internal developer platforms (IDP), provisioning, and environment automation.
- **Data & Observability**: Data pipelines, streaming, tracing, metrics, and log intelligence.
- **Automation & Ops**: GitOps, progressive delivery, chaos engineering, and resilience testing.

## 🚀 Execution Principles

1. Start small, measure, and iterate quickly.
2. Prioritize reusable capability blocks over one-off solutions.
3. Think in events and layered context.
4. Automate before optimizing for performance.
5. Make everything observable by default.
